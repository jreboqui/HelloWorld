Hi! My name is Junnel. I'll be transferring to UCSD this fall as a Computer Science major. Yes, I know, I should've learned how to use git like waaay before transferring but things are a bit differnt for me. I like to take things slow, really really really slow.

Right now, I'm trying to get ready for the classes I'll be taking this Fall 2016. That includes teaching myself python and learning vim, and git(hence why I'm here).
